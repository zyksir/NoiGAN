this is the code for NoiGAN
we do some modification on [KnowledgeGraphEmbedding](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/KnowledgeGraphEmbedding/branches)
the data 

- [ ] test how noise affects performance
  - [ ] different models(TransE, RotatE, DisMult, ComplEx)
  - [ ] different datasets(FB15k-237 and WN18RR)
  - [ ] different embedding dims(50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000)


- **main goal make generator work**
#### 2022.4.20
- get a better paper submission
  - performance drop is not good enough. especially in wn18rr.
  - study of generator: 
  - **what is good noise?**
